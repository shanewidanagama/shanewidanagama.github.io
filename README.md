# How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Responsive Tools (github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools)

I built this site by implementing features from highest to lowest priority. For example, I made the hero page first, where most people would land and get their first impressions, then worked on my projects section, and then about me page, and so on. I used Font Awesome (fontawesome.io) for the icons.
